Share documents is my final project for the ComIT Java backend course. It is a small backend application written using Spring Boot.

The main idea is to allow users to upload/download files and share them with other registered users.

Main features:
- [x] User registration;
- [x] User authorization (token-based);
- [x] Update user (first and last name);
- [x] Refresh token functionality;
- [x] Uploading files
- [x] Creating files
- [x] Sharing files with other users
- [ ] Inform a user in real-time that somebody shared a file with him. Probably using SSE (Server sent events)
- [x] Remove file
- [ ] File format validation
- [ ] Support other formats than PDF
